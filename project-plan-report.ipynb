The data started being logged after the incident in 2014 where Michael Brown, an unarmed black man was killed by the police. A post investigation of this incident showed that the FBI severely undercounted the number of police-caused fatalities and the reason being many departments failed to require reports of this kind.*\n",

The frequent and lawful police killings in just the last year have contributed to some of the hardest months of the pandemic. The connection between police killings and race has become an even bigger issue and has caused mass protesting and looting all over the country in the middle of a global pandemic. Some things we hope to learn with this research is the specific variables that contribute to fatalities and potentially ways to prevent them from happening. We want our project to be an educational and interesting read that may be helpful for further research in updating future police funding and practices.*"

However, officials of the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have confirmed that their data log for fatal shootings by police is incomplete, resulting in inaccurate analysis of our potential policing issue. Therefore, at the start of 2015, The Washington Post started a project to begin recording all future fatal shootings by on-duty police officers in the United States and various descriptors of the incident.

In 2015, the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented less than half of the amount of fatal shootings by police than the Washington Post.

The sampling frame consists of all entities in the population that were publicly reported in any form of way since Jan. 1, 2015. The sampling mechanism is a census and therefore our sample consists of all entities in our sampling frame.

    "The top 10 counties with fatal shootings in California all have the largest population in 2014. Hence, we can say that a possible reason the number of shootings are extremely high may be due to the high population amount or density. However, there is no relationship between income of persons below poverty and 2014 population. This suggests that poverty rate for counties in California might not be a good explanation for high number of shootings. "
